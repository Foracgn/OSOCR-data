# OSOCR-data
Data repo of os-ocr family, as we did promise to release data building scripts.

## WARNING
!!!!!!!These scripts WILL write A LOT of data to your disk.!!!!!!!!!

!!!!!!!MAKE SURE NOT TO OVERWRITE YOUR MAIN SSD.!!!!!!!

My suggestion is to buy a cheap used 240Gib SSD with 10~15 bucks, connect it through USB, and put the deploy folder on that poor drive.



## Status

Most things are here, but we are still testing it, ironing quirks, and making documents. 

ETA 10 days, likely to be finished before Xmeows. 

GLHF.
