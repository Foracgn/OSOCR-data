All datasets used for openset recognition includes:

ART, CTW HWDB LSVT MLT and RCTW

To perform the openset single character experiments, you need 
    -the ctw folder for the scene character recognition task
    -the hwdb folder for the scene character recognition task

To perform CHS-JAP cross language openset recognition, you need
    -All the following except the hwdb folder.
    
So, to generate one or more datasets used, you need to download the datasets to a folder.


After downloading, the data folder shall look like:

$ ls -R

./art:

Note that we assume you already uncompressed the images in the ctw dataset into the ./ctw/jpg folder. 
    The 26 tarballs have really weird and long random names due to wget and onedrive quirks, 
    so we will not include it in 
        the file structure and 
        the provided uncompressing scripts
To sum up, just make sure you have 25,887 images uncompressed into the ./ctw/jpg folder
before you start the following steps
###################################################################################

Now use the bash script to uncompress the datasets:


Finally, use the corresponding python scripts to generate lmdbs for a specific task.


As the dataset building code is very space consuming, It's recommended to have more than 500GiB disk space for it.
